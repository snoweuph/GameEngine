# Like I'm saying in the Description: I Want to do this with Minimal Help, that means:

## What can I contribute?

- Bugfixes
- Minor Code Improvements *-> for example: Speedup of Calculations*
- Documentation
- Feature Request
- Pointing out Problems

## How should I contribute?

### Bugfixes and Minor Code Improvements

fork the project and do a pullrequest to the ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Branch-dev-F05032?logo=git&style=flat-square) with the appropriate pull request template.
please name all your commits appropriate in an informative short way, for longer commit infos use the commit description.
**don't** stash all your commits together, stashing commits means losing the information of the Summaries and Description and should be used with caution.

### Documentation

#### JavaDoc

for JavaDoc the same Rules as for **Bugfixes and Minor Code Improvements** are applying.

#### Wiki

for now there is no Wiki, but there will be in the future, and then Contributors will be welcome.

### Feature Request

create a Issue with the Feature Request Template.

### Pointing out Problems

- If it's a Problem that is Code related, create a Issue with the appropriate Issue Template.
- If it's a Problem that is Project or Code Design related, use the Disscusion Tab.
